# Final Project - Build an ML Pipeline for Airfoil Noise Prediction

## Description
This project involves building a machine learning pipeline to predict the sound level of airfoils using the NASA Airfoil Self Noise dataset. The project covers data preprocessing, cleaning, model training, evaluation, and model persistence. It is designed to help data scientists efficiently work with structured data and machine learning algorithms.

## Scenario
As a data engineer at an aeronautics consulting company, your role is to:

1. Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks on the dataset.
2. Build a machine learning pipeline to predict sound levels based on aerodynamics data.
3. Assist data scientists by streamlining the workflow for analyzing airfoil noise.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles duplicate and null values in the dataset.
- **ML Pipeline**: Automates preprocessing, feature selection, and model training.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Model Persistence**: Saves the trained model for future use.
